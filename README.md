# Patreon TV Box (Raspberry Pi 5)

Turn your Raspberry Pi 5 into a Patreon TV box.

**Features:**
- On login, Chromium automatically launches to Patreon (fullscreen by default).
- Supports Google Sign-In by keeping Chromiumâ€™s profile intact between sessions.
- Remote control the Pi from iPhone or Mac via VNC.
- Auto-sync with this GitHub repo using a systemd timer.

---

## How It Works
1. Pi boots to Desktop.
2. `launcher.py` waits for network connectivity and then launches Chromium to `https://www.patreon.com/home`.
   - `PATRON_FULLSCREEN` (default `1`) controls fullscreen; set to `0` for a normal window.
   - `PATRON_KIOSK=1` launches in kiosk mode.
   - Adjust `NETWORK_TIMEOUT` (seconds) if your connection takes longer to come up.
3. Videos play on your TV via HDMI.
4. If the Git auto-pull timer is enabled, changes to this repo will appear on the Pi within 60 seconds.
